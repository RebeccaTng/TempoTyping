## Context
This was a project for the course Software Development at Group T KU Leuven.

## Description
This is inspired by [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) but on a mobile phone. Type the text displayed on the phone screen as fast a possible within a certain time limit. Scores are expressed in wpm (words per minute). There are 2 gamemodes available, one where a sensible normal text is to be overwritten and one with scrabbled words and letters. A leaderboard is available to compare yourself with others.
